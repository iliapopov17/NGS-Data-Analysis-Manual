_Typical workflow of NGS data analysis_

## Much more to be disclosured soon:
- Whole Genome and Pangenome Analyses
- 16S Amplicon Analysis (soon)
- Maybe someday HiC...?

## 04 Phylogenetics ðŸŒ³

In the [Phylogenetics folder](04_Phylogenetics) there is a complete pipeline of simple research in phylogenetics, from working with NCBI (and other databases) to building trees, evaluating them, and getting some worthwhile results.

## 02 Genomic Variation Analysis ðŸ§¬

In the [Genomic Variation Analysis folder](02_Genomic_Variation_Analysis) there is a detailed guide how to conduct studies on Variant Calling using `fastqc`, `trimmomatic`, `bwa`, `samtools`, `abra2`, `bcftools`, `snpEff` & `SnpSift`

## 01 Quality Control of raw data ðŸ’Ž

In the [Quality Control folder](01_Quality_Control) there is a detailed guide how to conduct quality control of raw data using `fastqc` and `trimmomatic`.
