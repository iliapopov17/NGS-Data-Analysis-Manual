Cyclophilin A (Cyp A) is the main intracellular receptor of cyclosporin A (CsA) 
belonging to the immunophilin family, which is known as an effective 
immunosuppressive drug. This study aimed to gain insights into the structure and 
biological function of cyclophilin A in the red swamp crayfish, Procambarus 
clarkii (PcCypA). We cloned PcCypA by homology cloning and anchored polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR), and assessed its mRNA and protein expression levels in 
different tissues using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis, 
respectively. The full-length DNA contained a 5' untranslated region (UTR) 
comprising 108 base pairs (bp), an open reading frame of 495 bp encoding a 
polypeptide of 164 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 17.3 kDa, and 
a 3' UTR of 281 bp including a significant poly(A) plus tail sequence. The 
predicted amino acid sequence of PcCypA shared high identity with CypA in other 
organisms. PcCypA transcripts were detected in the hepatopancreas, gill, heart, 
muscle, testis, and ovary of crayfish, with the highest expression levels in the 
heart. Western blot analysis found one 17-kDa band in all of the tissues 
examined, except for the ovary. Molecular identification and expression analysis 
of PcCypA will facilitate further studies of the immune defense mechanisms in 
red swamp crayfish, and provide new insights into freshwater invertebrate 
immunology.

The techniques of homology cloning and anchored PCR were used to clone the 
cyclophilin A (CypA) gene from black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon). The 
full-length cDNA of black tiger shrimp CypA (btsCypA) contained a 5' 
untranslated region (UTR) of 81 bp, an ORF (open reading frame) of 495 bp 
encoding a polypeptide of 164 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 
17.68 kDa and a 3' UTR of 308 bp. The predicted amino acid sequence of btsCypA 
shared high identity with CypA in other organisms. A quantitative reverse 
transcriptase Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was developed to assess the mRNA 
expression of btsCypA in different tissues and the temporal expression of 
btsCypA in the hepatopancreas challenged by lipopolyssacharide (LPS). 
Higher-level mRNA expression of btsCypA was detected in the tissues of 
hepatopancreas and blood. The expression of btsCypA in the hepatopancreas was up 
regulated after stimulated by LPS. The results indicated that btsCypA was a 
constitutive and inducible expressed protein and could be induced by LPS.

A cyclophilin A inducible expressed in gonad of zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri.

Cyclophilin A (CypA), a receptor for the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A 
(CsA), is a cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) which accelerates the 
cis-trans isomerization of prolyl-peptide bonds, interacts with a variety of 
proteins and therefore regulates their activities. One CypA (designated CfCypA) 
cDNA was cloned from Chlamys farreri by expressed sequence tag (EST) and rapid 
amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) techniques. The full-length cDNA of CfCypA 
consisted of 1,248 nucleotides with a canonical polyadenylation signal sequence 
AATAAA, a poly (A) tail, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 495 nucleotides 
encoding a polypeptide of 164 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence 
shared high similarity with CypA from the other species, indicating that CfCypA 
should be a new member of the CypA family. Quantitative real-time (RT) PCR was 
employed to assess the mRNA expression of CfCypA in various tissues and its 
temporal expression in haemocytes and gonad of scallops challenged with Vibrio 
anguillarum. The mRNA transcripts of CfCypA could be detected in all the 
examined tissues with highest expression level in gonad. After bacterial 
challenge, the expression level of CfCypA was almost unchanged in haemocytes, 
but up-regulated in gonad and increased to the peak (22.59-fold; P < 0.05) at 4 
h post-injection, and then dropped to the original level at 8 h post-injection. 
These results indicated that CfCypA was constitutive expressed in haemocytes, 
but could be induced in gonad, and perhaps played a critical role in response to 
the bacterial challenge in gonad.
